Facial Recognition and Real-time Sentiment Detection System

This project utilizes UML (Unified Modeling Language) and BPMN (Business Process Model and Notation) diagrams to streamline the development process of a facial recognition system integrated with real-time sentiment detection. 
These diagrams serve to illustrate the system's architecture, workflows, and processes, providing a clear roadmap for coding implementation.
